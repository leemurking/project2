# PROJECT 2
#### A web application based on the Akan Culture, June, 2021
#### By **Grant Okello**
## Description
This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. 
Here are Ghanian day names;
- Sunday: Kwasi
- Monday: Kwadwo
- Tuesday: Kwabena
- Wednesday: Kwaku
- Thursday:  Yaw
- Friday: Kofi
- Saturday: Kwame
. It entails some background information about myself from birth to where I am right now. It also details some projects i have done since joining Moringa School and learning how to code.
