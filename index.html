            <p>The Akan are a meta-ethnicity predominantly speaking Central Tano languages and
                 residing in the southern regions of the former Gold Coast region in what is today
                 the nation of Ghana. Akans who historically migrated from Ghana also make up a
                 plurality of the populace in the Ivory Coast. The Akan language (also known as Twi/Fante)
                 is a group of dialects within the Central Tano branch of the Potou–Tano subfamily
                 of the Niger–Congo family.

            <p>Akan conflicts led to a high number of military captives being sold into slavery
               known as "Coromantee". These Coromantee soldiers and other Akan captives were
               notorious for a large number of slave revolts and plantation resistance tactics.
               These captives were feared throughout the Americas so much so that we can see their
               legacy within groups such as the Maroons of the Caribbean and South America.

            <p>Akan culture can also be found in the New World.A number of Akans were taken as
                 captives to the Americas. Roughly ten-percent of all slave ships embarked from the
                 Gold Coast. The primary source of wealth within Akan economy was gold. However as
                 wars culminate in the region the capture and sale of Akan people peaked during
                 the Fante and Ashanti conflicts (as both sides sold a large number of their captives)
                 as prisoners of war.

                  <h1>AKAN <span>NAMES</span>.</h1>
                  <p class="r">Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first
                      name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
                      These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle
                      names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
                      ancestor's middle name.
